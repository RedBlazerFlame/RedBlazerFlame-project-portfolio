            <h1>About This Program</h1>
            <p>
                This program generates new anime characters using <a target = "_blank" href = "https://youtu.be/8L11aMN5KY8">Generative Adversarial Networks</a>, a type of <a target = "_blank" href = "https://openai.com/blog/generative-models/">generative model</a> composed of two <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/neural-networks">neural networks</a>: a Generator, and a Discriminator.<br><br>

                    The network was trained on 102 passes of 8000 faces of anime characters obtained from <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.kaggle.com/splcher/animefacedataset">https://www.kaggle.com/splcher/animefacedataset</a>.<br><br>

                    One of the biggest problems that I found with the outputs is that the images are rather similar to one another. This is a problem known as <a target = "_blank" href = "https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/blogs/mode-collapse-in-gans.html"> mode collapse </a>. It is an active area of research in GANs. To fix this problem, I decided to save multiple versions of the model and then pick a random version to generate a random image from. This helped increase the variation in the generated outputs.
